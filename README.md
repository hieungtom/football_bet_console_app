# Football Betting Console Application
This is a required school project in a subject that introduced me to C#. Throughout the course I learnt basics of C# and also used my knowledge of C which helped me a lot. I made an application that would replicate the very basics of a regular betting application for football matches. This console application starts by welcoming the user then it shows the menu to the user where the user makes a selection of choices and all the inputs are checked to make sure that there is no error. After the user uses all the available matches the application proceeds to end itself.


<h2>Some functions of the console app:</h2>

  Show available matches from a file dynamically and then select each one based on a choice. Same match cant be selected twice as well as a match that the user already made a bet on.
  
   - Select a bet rate of the selected match and remembering the choice.
  
  Deposit money with some limits.

  Showing current ticket with its selected matches and bet rates. If the current ticket doesnt have a selected match and a bet rate then it shows an error proceeding to select a match.
  
   - Bet and based on the winning/losing result which is decided right after selecting a rate. Balance is updated and rate is resetted.
          
   - Delete the ticket (resetting selected matches but NOT used matches and resetting the rate).
          
  Showing the last ticket user bet on. If he didnt make a bet yet then it shows an error proceeding to make a bet.
